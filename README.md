# Superspeed Seeds: Racing Royale üöÄ

**A chaotic, seed-powered racing game where redemption means reaching the Mainnet! Built for the SuperSeed Tesla Contest.**

---

## üéÆ Game Overview

Once a mighty **Superseed**, your powers vanished in the catastrophic **Liquidation Event**, a fallout from the **Dark Winds**. To reclaim your status, you must ascend the treacherous, 100-level **Tower of Seeds**, dodge relentless **Fudders**, and race towards the ultimate goal: the **MAINNET**.

But beware! **David**, the furious founder of the Superseed Chain, blames *you* for the **TGE delay** and hunts every Seed in the tower. Your journey is a race against time, debt, and David himself.

Choose your **SeedDriver**, master unique abilities, collect **Seeds** for upgrades, conquer challenging worlds, and maybe, just maybe, survive long enough to see the **TGE**.

## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Download/Clone:**
    *   Download the project files (e.g., as a ZIP and extract it) OR clone the repository using Git:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Danielkis97/Superspeed-Seeds-Racing-Royale/
        ```
2.  **Navigate to Project Folder:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Use the `cd` command to go into the main project folder (the one containing `main.py`, `Assets`, `media`, etc.).
        ```bash
        cd path/to/Superspeed-Seeds-Racing-Royale  
        ```
         or
         ```bash
        cd Superspeed-Seeds-Racing-Royale
           ```
3.  **Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    *   It's best practice to create an isolated environment for the project's dependencies.
    *   **Create:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        ```
        *(If `python` doesn't work, try `python3`)*. This creates a `.venv` folder in your project directory.
    *   **Activate:**
        *   **Windows (Command Prompt):** `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
        *   **Windows (PowerShell):** `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (You might need to adjust execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process`)
        *   **macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):** `source .venv/bin/activate`
    *   You'll know it's active when you see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

4.  **Install Requirements:**
    *   **With the virtual environment active**, install the necessary libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install pygame numpy moviepy
        ```
        *(If `pip` doesn't work, try `pip3`)*.
        *Note: `numpy` and `moviepy` are only needed for the optional intro video.*
5.  **Run the Game:**
    *   **Make sure your virtual environment is still active.**
    *   Run the main script:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
        *(If `python` doesn't work, try `python3`)*.
6.  **Enjoy!** Use the main menu options to start, view leaderboards, manage permanent upgrades (Vault), or see achievements.
7.  **(Optional) Deactivate Environment:** When you're done playing, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing `deactivate` in the terminal and pressing Enter.
