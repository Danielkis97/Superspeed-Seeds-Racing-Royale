### 🚀 A chaotic, seed-powered racing game for the SuperSeed Tesla Contest!

## 🎮 Game Overview

Once a mighty **Superseed**, you’ve lost your powers to the **Withering Curse of the Dark Winds**. Your only hope is to climb the shattered **Tower of Seeds** and reclaim your rightful superseed status by conquering **100 challenging levels**. 

**Dodge the Fudders**, harness dynamic weather effects, collect seeds to **purchase powerful upgrades**, and race toward the **MAINNET** finish line. Each world introduces unique obstacles and increasingly formidable enemies. **Do you have the speed and skill to reclaim your destiny?**
