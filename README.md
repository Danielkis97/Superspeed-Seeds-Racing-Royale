# Superspeed Seeds: Racing Royale 🚀

**A chaotic, seed-powered racing game where redemption means reaching the Mainnet! Built for the SuperSeed Tesla Contest.**

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

Once a mighty **Superseed**, your powers vanished in the catastrophic **Liquidation Event**, a fallout from the **Dark Winds**. To reclaim your status, you must ascend the treacherous, 100-level **Tower of Seeds**, dodge relentless **Fudders**, and race towards the ultimate goal: the **MAINNET**.

But beware! **David**, the furious founder of the Superseed Chain, blames *you* for the **TGE delay** and hunts every Seed in the tower. Your journey is a race against time, debt, and David himself.

Choose your **SeedDriver**, master unique abilities, collect **Seeds** for upgrades, conquer challenging worlds, and maybe, just maybe, survive long enough to see the **TGE**.
